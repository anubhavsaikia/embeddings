# embeddings

The code is the final model I settled upon to create the word embeddings.The first three files contain embedding matrices trained on text corpora smaller than the corpus1.txt, the fourth file "my_embeddings_4.txt" is trained on corpus1.txt using negative sampling and has embeddings of over 78900 words with an accuracy of 95.04 %. Please feel free to comment and give suggestions so that I can also learn from the developer community.
