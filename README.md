# embeddings

The code is the final model I settled upon to create the word embeddings. The three embedding files contain embeddings of different 
words. The three files contain embedding matrices trained on different text corpora, however due to hardware limitations I could not 
train the model on a huge amount of data. Please feel free to comment and give suggestions so that I can also learn from the developer
community.
